# fun-with-bash

My introduction to programming was through Java and JavaScript. I learned command line but mainly as a means of navigation. After running into some trouble installing Python3 and not getting Pip3 (though I resolved through the right thread( and no sudo, chmod or chown did not work) I decided I needed to build a better foundation of scripting and Bash in general. This repo was just a sandbox of me learning and playing with certain things. I simply wanted to created a program that executed an external script so I could get a sense of how that work. Nothing complicated here just messing around and having fun. It was actually cool to write this README file using the nano editor!
